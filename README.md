# Algorithms in Graphs  
Project developed for the Graph Theory course at the Federal University of Alagoas.

### 🧠 Dijkstra  
Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

### 🌲 Prim  
Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. It uses a min-heap to determine the next vertex with the lowest edge cost.

### 🔗 Kruskal  
Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph by sorting all the edges in increasing order of weight and adding them one by one, as long as they don’t form a cycle.

### 🔁 Kosaraju  
Kosaraju's algorithm is used to find all strongly connected components in a directed graph. It performs two depth-first searches: one on the original graph and one on its transpose.
